# Nasdaq-100-Analysis
I will be collecting data from Yahoo Finance and analysing the Nasdaq Index performance 
I have prepared the data on Juptyter Lab. I have pulled the Nasdaq's Historical Data, the individual company stock performance and have also found the index weights.
# Streamlit
On the Streamlit app, there are options to select what company from the Nasdaq 100 you want to analyse. You will then see 6 financial indicators on the top right, the index historical value on the bottom left and the comapnies historical data on the bottom right.
